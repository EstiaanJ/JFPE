Java Version: 25 (code style), built with Java 21 toolchain via Maven for this repo

Functional Programming Style

Immutable where possible

Composition over Inheritance

Use records for physics constructs and shapes when practical

Keep the runtime free of external libraries (tests use JUnit 5)

Favor axis-aligned primitives for rectangles and boundaries unless a task explicitly requires rotation
